<p align="center">

> A decentralized open-sourced creative ecosystem built on Clarity and Web3, empowering artists, filmmakers, musicians, game developers, and the broader creative industry.

## Core Vision

SiHiRi is not just a platform — it's a **Creative Operating System** for creation, collaboration, distribution, royalties, and preservation of art in all forms:

- Built with **Clarity smart contracts**, decentralized storage, and modular updates
- A hub where creativity meets AI co-creation, DAOs, NFTs, gamification, and cultural preservation
- A single marketplace where every brushstroke, beat, 3D model, film frame, or shader is not just uploaded — it's alive

## Development Principles

- **Artist-first** → creators own their work, their royalties, and their audience
- **Open Source** → transparent, community-driven, forkable
- **Interoperable** → works anywhere across Web2 & Web3
- **Inclusive** → onboarding for underrepresented artists globally
- **Future-proof** → AI-assisted, modular, decentralized forever

## The SiHiRi Ecosystem

We are building a digital economy where:

- 🎨 Artists mint layers of creativity (designs, textures, models, music, storyboards, etc) as building blocks
- 🎮 Game studios plug into this open library to source characters, worlds, and mechanics — with royalties flowing back to creators forever
- 🎥 Filmmakers commission renders, animations, and VFX from a global pool of render-nodes and collaborators, paid instantly in STX
- 🖼 Collectors don't just buy art, they own the provenance of entire creative chains — who modeled the character, who textured it, who rigged it, who directed the scene
- ⚡ Fans subscribe to artists and studios directly, co-own works-in-progress, and unlock scenes as living NFTs
- 🏛 Curators and galleries run DAOs to showcase, fund, and archive cultural works on Bitcoin

This isn't a static NFT marketplace. It's a creative operating system:

- Built on Clarity smart contracts (royalties, provenance, collaboration splits)
- Powered by decentralized render jobs (escrow + attestations)
- Linked through IPFS/Arweave archives (no asset ever disappears)
- Governed by creators themselves through DAOs
